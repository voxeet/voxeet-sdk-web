/**
 * Emitted in the following situations:
 * - A conference participant with disabled audio and video enables audio or video
 * - A conference participant starts sharing a screen
 *
 * Each conference participant can be connected to two streams: `audio and video stream` and `screen-share stream`. If a participant enables audio or video, the SDK adds the `audio and video stream` to the participant. However, when a participant who is connected to the `audio and video stream` changes the stream, the SDK updates the `audio and video stream`. For example, this situation occurs when a participant who enabled a microphone also enables a camera. In such a situation, the SDK emits the [streamUpdated](#streamupdated) event. The following graphic shows this behavior:
 *
 * <img src="/images/streams_events_3.png" alt="Audio streams map"
 * 	title="Audio streams map" width="1500">
 *
 * When a participant joins a conference with enabled audio and video, the SDK emits the streamAdded event that includes audio and video tracks.
 *
 * **Note**: In Dolby Voice conferences, each conference participant receives only one mixed audio stream from the server. To keep backward compatibility with the customers' implementation, SDK 3.0 introduces a faked audio track for audio transmission. The faked audio track is included in the streamAdded and [streamRemoved](#streamremoved) events. The SDK 3.0 takes the audio stream information from the [participantAdded](#participantadded) and [participantUpdated](#participantupdated) events.

/**
 * Emitted when a conference participant who is connected to the `audio and video` stream changes the stream by enabling a microphone while using a camera or by enabling a camera while using a microphone.

 *
 * The SDK can also emit the streamUpdated event only for the local participant. When the local participant uses the [stopAudio](#stopaudio) or [startAudio](#startaudio) method to locally mute or unmute a selected remote participant who uses a camera, the local participant receives the streamUpdated event.
 *
 * The streamUpdated event can be also triggered by a load rebalance mechanism that prevents a conference from overloading. When a new participant joins a conference, the SDK creates a PeerConnection with a media server. When too many participants are connected to a specific server, they may overload a conference. To avoid this scenario, the load and rebalance mechanism closes PeerConnection between a participant who may overload a conference and a media server and creates a new PeerConnection with a new server. This mechanism is almost invisible for conference participants; the SDK only emits the streamUpdated event.
