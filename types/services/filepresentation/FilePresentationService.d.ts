/**
 * The FilePresentationService allows presenting files during a conference. The Dolby.io Communications APIs service converts the user-provided file into multiple pages, as images, accessible through the [image](#image) method.
 *
 * **The file presentation workflow:**
 *
 * **1.** The presenter calls the [convert](#convert) method to upload and convert a file.
 *
 * **2.** The presenter receives the [conversionProgress](#conversionprogress) event that informs that the file conversion is in progress.
 *
 * **3.** The presenter receives [converted](#converted) event when the file conversion is finished.
 *
 * **4.** The presenter calls the [start](#start) method to start presenting the file.
 *
 * **5.** The presenter and the viewers receive the [started](#started) event that informs that the file presentation starts. Upon receiving the [started](#started) event, call the [image](#image) method to get the converted file images URLs and display the proper page of the file by retrieving the individual images.
 *
 * **6.** The application is responsible for coordinating the page flip between the local and the presented files. The presenter calls the [update](#update) method to inform the service to send the updated page number to the participants.
 *
 * **7.** The presenter and viewers receive the [updated](#updated) event with the current page number. Receiving the [updated](#updated) event should trigger calling the [image](#image) method to display the proper page of the file by retrieving the individual images.
 *
 * **8.** The presenter may call the [thumbnail](#thumbnail) method to obtain thumbnail images of the file and implement a carousel control for the presenting user to flip pages locally.
 *
 * **9.** The presenter calls the [stop](#stop) method to end the file presentation.
 *
 * **10.** The presenter and the viewers receive the [stopped](#stopped) event to inform about the end of the file presentation.
 *
 * The following diagram presents the easiest workflow for presenting files during a conference.
